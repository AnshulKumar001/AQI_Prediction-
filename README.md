# AQI_Prediction

>  Predicting Air Quality Index (AQI) like a boss — accurate, explainable, and ready for real-world impact.

##  What's This?
This project uses machine learning to forecast **AQI levels**, so we know when to flex those air filters or plan outdoor vibes accordingly.

##  Why It Matters
- **Health first**: AQI ties directly to breathing quality—stay ahead, stay safe.
- **Proactive vibes**: Predict before you step outside.
- **Clarity over chaos**: Understand your model's output, not just stare at numbers.
